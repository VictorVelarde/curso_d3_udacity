# Overview
PISA is a survey of students' skills and knowledge as they approach the end of compulsory education. It is not a conventional school test. Rather than examining how well students have learned the school curriculum, it looks at how well prepared they are for life beyond school.
Around 510,000 students in [65 economies](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.oecd.org/pisa/aboutpisa/pisa-2012-participants.htm&sa=D&ust=1494230992216000&usg=AFQjCNE6oIb8_dZm6mInMdjvXRFb1parDA) took part in the PISA 2012 assessment of reading, mathematics and science representing about 28 million 15-year-olds globally. Of those economies, 44 took part in an assessment of creative problem solving and 18 in an assessment of financial literacy.
The data and topics of investigation come from the [PISA Data Visualization Competition](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisaproducts/datavisualizationcontest.htm&sa=D&ust=1494230992218000&usg=AFQjCNGEzjaJvNZCRcMCqD6FoDTvOus-yw).
