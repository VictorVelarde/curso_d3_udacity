# Project Overview
For this project, you will create a data visualization from a data set that tells a story or allows a reader to explore trends or patterns. You will need to use either dimple.js or d3.js to create the visualization. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

## What do I need to install?
To work on your data visualization, you will need to start a local server on your computer. To start a local web server, you will need to have Python 2.7.8 or higher installed on your machine.

If you do not have Python installed on your machine, please watch the instructions for Downloading Python. These instructions come from the Programming Foundations with Python course.

Once you have Python installed, you can start a local web server and view your data visualization. Refer to the following video to see how to do so.

Remember, you must start your web server in the top level directory to serve all code and data files. If you do not use this folder as the root directory for the web server, be aware that you will need to change the file paths.

There are other ways to start a local web server. To learn more about why you need to start a local web server and other ways of setting up a local web server, please read Setting Up A Local Web Server from Scott Murray's book, Interactive Data Visualization for the Web.

## Why this Project?
This project will touch on the overarching attitudes and beliefs important to effective data visualization, such as:

- visualization is a dialog
- showcasing and sharing visualization with others
- visualization is a fluid process that typically requires multiple iterations of improvements

You will have an opportunity to experience the end-to-end process of creating effective data visualizations and highlighting important information from data that may otherwise be hidden or hard to uncover.

## What will I learn?
After completing the project, you will be able to:

* Demonstrate the ability to choose optimal visual elements to encode data and critically assess the effectiveness of the visualization
* Communicate a story or finding to the appropriate audience using interactive visualizations
* Undergo the iterative process of creating a visualization, and build interactive visualizations with dimple.js or d3.js.

## Why is this Important to my Career?
Data analyst are storytellers that can translate data findings that other people can easily understand. They view data visualization as an important form of communication.

If you, as a data analyst, can create visualizations to explore data, articulate clear findings to drive business decisions, or use data to elicit consensus from diverse perspectives, then you will be a deeply invaluable member on your team.
